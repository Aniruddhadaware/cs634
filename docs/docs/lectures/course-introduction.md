## Summary
Why we are all here?

* AI is still in its infancy especially when:
  * the system learns in one domain and is able to generalize in others.
  * control loops and long term uncertainty are involved.
* Efforts concentrate currently in bringing simulation and deep generative network approaches together.

This is a  nautical analogy on where we are today on AI for mission critical systems. Can you notice anything strange with this ship (Cumberland Basin, photo taken April 1844)?

Many emerging AI systems combine simulation and generative / predictive approaches from Deep Learning. In many mission critical systems everything must be  __explainable__.
