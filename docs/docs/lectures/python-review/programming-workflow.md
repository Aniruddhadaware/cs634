## Git
Git is the defacto standard when it comes to code version control. Learning basic git commands takes less than half an hour. However, to install git and understand the principle behind git, please go over chapters 1 and 2 of the [ProGit book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).

As we have discussed in class you need to be able to publish your work in Github so you need to create a Github account. Then you will use the git client for your operating system to interact with github and iterate in your projects.
