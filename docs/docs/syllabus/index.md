## Highlights

The process of learning is a multistep endeavor that involves, data analysis, visualization, learning algorithms, model analysis  - all done in a well orchestrated framework to deliver automated machine intelligence to systems and platforms that require it. 

We start by reviewing mathematical principles from linear algebra and probability as well as programming techniques in Python - these are usually prerequisites for this course.  

On the algorithmic side we will cover both classical machine learning, in supervised and unsupervised settings, as well as deeper architectures (convolutional neural networks) in supervised setting only. The schedule below provides details on the syllabus.

## Textbooks
The following textbooks will be used (bibtex notation)

* Bishop, https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/pattern-recognition-machine-learning/
This leading textbook provides a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. Now available to download in full as a PDF for free.

* Goodfellow et.al. "https://www.deeplearningbook.org/" Its a classic on the deep learning literature. We will go through selective chapters up to Chapter 9. 

* Aurélien Géron, "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems".
