## ðŸš€ Get Up and Running in 5 Minutes
This site is based on Gatsbyjs.org. After you clone this repository, 

    ```sh
    cd www/
    npm install
    gatsby develop
    ```

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`. You can now edit any markdown file under docs/. Save your changes, and the browser will update in real time. 

At this point, youâ€™ve got a fully functional course website. For additional information on how you can customize your site, see our [plugins](https://gatsbyjs.org/plugins/) and [the official tutorial](https://gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).
